# Parameter-Optimization

In this assignment, following steps have been followed:
- Selection of multi-class dataset from UCI Library.
- Division of the dataset into 70-30 for training and testing with 10 different samples.
- Optimization of the SVM for every sample with 1000 iterations
- Representation of best parameters in the form of table 
- Plotting the convergence graph for the sample whose accuracy is maximum
- Basic Data Analytics of the dataset
