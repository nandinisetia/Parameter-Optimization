# Parameter-Optimization

In this assignment, following steps have been followed:
- Selection of multi-class dataset from UCI Library.
- Division of the dataset into 70-30 for training and testing with 10 different samples.
- Optimization of the SVM for every sample with 1000 iterations
- Representation of best parameters in the form of table 
- Plotting the convergence graph for the sample whose accuracy is maximum
- Basic Data Analytics of the dataset

# Histogram of wine quality
This plot shows the distribution of wine quality scores in the dataset. The majority of wines are rated between 5 and 7, with fewer wines rated below 5 or above 8.

# Scatter plot of pH vs. alcohol
 This plot shows the relationship between pH and alcohol content in the wine. There appears to be a weak positive correlation between these two variables, meaning that as pH increases, alcohol content tends to increase slightly as well.

# Box Plot of Residual Sugar by quality
 This plot shows the distribution of residual sugar levels across different wine quality ratings. Higher quality wines tend to have lower residual sugar levels, while lower quality wines tend to have higher residual sugar levels.

# Density plot of citric acid by quality
This plot shows the distribution of citric acid levels across different wine quality ratings. Higher quality wines tend to have slightly higher citric acid levels than lower quality wines, although the difference is not very large.

# Bar plot of quality counts by alcohol level
The bar plot of quality counts by alcohol level shows the distribution of wine quality ratings for different levels of alcohol content. The plot is divided into different bars, each representing a range of alcohol content levels. The height of each bar indicates the number of wines within that range of alcohol content levels, and the different colors within each bar represent the different quality ratings.
